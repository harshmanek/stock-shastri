The market movement came in tandem with another selloff in bond markets, with the yield on 10-year US government debt surging past 3.5% for the first time since April 2011. 2022-09-19T14:44:18.6",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,4,,2022-09-19

Money markets are pricing a 75% chance of a 50-bps hike in December. On the corporate side, Deere & Co jumped 5% after the world's largest farm equipment company reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Conversely, Nordstrom dropped over 8% after the fashion retailer offered weak guidance. Meanwhile, weekly claims rose more than expected to a three-month high last week, while durable goods orders beat estimates in October.2022-11-23T14:39:00",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,3,,2022-11-23

The blue-chip Dow is now poised for its best daily performance since June 2020, while the other two indexes were on track for their best day since April 2020. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that the annual inflation rate eased to 7.7%, below economists’ forecasts of 8%, reinforcing the case for a modest 50 bps hike in December. The report also showed the CPI coming in softer than expected on a month-on-month basis, as well as in its core reading. The market movement came along with a softening dollar and Treasury yields, which brought some respite to beaten-down technology and other high-growth stocks. Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, were up between 6% and 10%.

US policymakers are nearing a deal on around $900 billion coronavirus-aid, that would include a second round of direct payments to Americans struggling amid the pandemic. This unprecedented spending is leading to large budget and current account deficits and has made the dollar an increasingly unattractive investment. At the same time, a less dovish stance from the Federal Reserve failed to bring back investors' interest. The Central Bank did not change the terms of its asset purchase program and painted a rosier growth outlook for 2021, but noted that fund rates are poised to be near zero thought at least 2023.2020-12-17T09:57:00",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,2,,2020-12-17

The latest reading pointed to the weakest expansion in the private sector since May 2016, as manufacturing output dropped to its lowest since 2009 (PMI at 50.6 vs 52.6 in April) and the services activity growth eased to a 39-month low (PMI at 50.9 vs 53).

Among data, the Commerce Department reported that its PCE inflation rate rose 3.4% year-on-year in May, the fastest increase since the early 1990, while a separate report showed that personal spending stagnated. Investors seem to have acknowledged that the Fed just wanted to signal it was ready to deal with higher inflation without taking any steps to pull back its crisis-era stimulus.

The latest reading pointed to the third consecutive expansion in the services sector and the sharpest in since April 2015. The quicker rate of growth was largely linked to more robust demand conditions, despite a slower upturn in new export business. Firms continued to work through backlogs accumulated during lockdown, but pressure on capacity eased and employment consequently rose at the softest pace for three months. Optimism about business levels in one year’s time improved to the strongest since April 2018 principally amid hopes of an end to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis and additional stimulus during the pandemic.2020-11-04T14:49:00",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,1,,2020-11-04

Investors have been increasingly betting on the scenario of two consecutive 50 bps rate hikes in the Federal Reserve funds rate, in May and June. The case for such moves has been strengthened by recent comments from Fed governors and policymakers arguing for a sustained tightening in monetary policy, after data showed consumer prices rising the most in four decades last month and producer prices climbing at the fastest pace since 2010.

The reading pointed to the 4th consecutive month of growth in factory activity and the strongest since January of 2019, marking a further move away from April's nadir. Output growth was the sharpest since November of 2019, driven by stronger client demand and higher new order inflows. New order growth picked up due to more robust client demand, with some firms noting larger orders being placed. Although domestic demand ticked higher, new export orders fell for the first time since July due to reimposed coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Europe. Reflecting weaker pressure on capacity, firms increased their workforce numbers at a softer pace. Meanwhile, average cost burdens increased at the steepest rate since January of 2019. Business expectations remained positive, improving on September’s 4-month low, as firms foresee a rise in output over the coming year.

The decline in service sector activity (43.7 vs 37.3 in July) more than offset the slight growth for US manufacturers (51.5 vs 52.2). Service providers registered a sharp decline in production and the downturn in new orders accelerated to a two-year low, while output and new business also contracted for US factories. Although still rising markedly, the rate of cost inflation softened to the slowest pace since January 2021, as lower demand drove companies to offer concessions to clients. In the meantime, employment growth dropped to January lows for both sectors. Pressure on capacity eased further for private companies as weaker demand cleared backlogs of work for service providers, while that for manufacturers rose marginally. 2022-09-06T14:25:24.867",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,1,,2022-09-06

This unprecedented spending is leading to large budget and current account deficits and has made the dollar an increasingly unattractive investment.

The US economy created the most jobs in 7 months in March, the payrolls report showed, and President Biden unveiled a $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan to boost the economic recovery, although the package is likely to face strong GOP opposition specially over a corporate tax hike increase to 28%.

US Economy Improved but Inflation is Rising: Fed Chair,Interest Rate,"US Economy Improved but Inflation is Rising: Fed ChairUnited States Interest RateThe economy has shown sustained improvement due to widespread vaccination and unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions, Fed Chair Powell said in a testimony before the House regarding the Fed's response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, inflation has increased notably in recent months reflecting low base effects, the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices; the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen; and the exacerbating factor of supply bottlenecks, which have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal. Investors will not turn their attention to the hearing for further clues on the tapering timeline. The Fed left the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0-0.25% in June 2021 but policymakers signalled they expect two increases by the end of 2023. 2021-06-22T07:58:00",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,0,,2021-06-22

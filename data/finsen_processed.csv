Worries now mount that such an effort to bring down inflation to its 2% target will push the US into a recession as borrowing costs increase for companies and individual borrowers. The market movement came in tandem with another selloff in bond markets, with the yield on 10-year US government debt surging past 3.5% for the first time since April 2011. 2022-09-19T14:44:18.6",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,4,

Powell said further rate increases are likely ahead as inflation “remains well above” the Fed’s 2% target despite signs that price pressures have been cooling. He added that the timing of rate moves will be decided at each meeting and it makes sense to move rates at a more moderate pace. Analysts argued that a lot of hawkishness from Powell was already priced in, with markets betting the central bank would raise rates again by 25 basis point in July and stop hiking after that. Investors now look ahead to more comments from Powell as he appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.25 days ago",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,2,

The reading continued to point to a third consecutive month of falling factory activity, albeit the contraction eased compared to December (46.2). The downturn was driven by a sharp contraction in new orders, a further drop in output and ongoing efforts to reduce inventories. Weak demand conditions stemmed from subdued sales across both domestic and export markets. Meanwhile, input costs and output charges rose at increased rates as price pressures strengthened again, despite suppliers' delivery times broadly stabilising and a marked contraction in input buying. Also, a lower new order inflows and a strong decline in backlogs of work caused the rate of job creation to slow further. Nonetheless, business confidence ticked higher amid hopes of stronger demand in the months ahead, greater supply chain stability and investment in new products.2023-02-01T14:52:48.917",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,2,

Bitcoin Steady After Volatile Week,Currency,"Bitcoin Steady After Volatile WeekUnited States CurrencyBitcoin settled around $65,000 on Monday, after hitting fresh all time highs last week around $69,000, as cryptocurrencies navigated volatile markets amid surging global inflation. US consumer prices registered at a three-decade high of 6.2% in October YoY, sending bitcoin and gold prices higher. Cryptocurrencies have been rallying since July due to inflation fears, dovish central bank statements and increasing government acceptance. A recent Bloomberg analysis also showed that inflation and hedging against uncertainty accounted for 50% of Bitcoin’s price moves, while the other half was driven by momentum trading. Meanwhile, expectations of higher interest rates due to surging inflation may hurt high valuation risk assets, including Bitcoin, as cryptocurrencies largely thrived under a high inflation, low rate environment.2021-11-15T08:35:11.707",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,2,

Retail sales expanded at a faster rate than expected in October, suggesting some resilience in household spending despite the slowing economy. Still, money markets point to a broad consensus that the Fed will slow the pace of its rate hikes in its next meeting as both consumer and producer inflation were below expectations for October. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard signaled that the central bank could soon ease the tightening rate, saying that policymakers had already done a significant job in taming inflation. Fed Governor Christopher Waller echoed a similar view but emphasized that the central bank is not close to a pause. 2022-11-16T13:41:00",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,1,

The greenback was lifted by bets on faster US interest rate hikes and worries about growth in Europe and China.

US Imports Fall for 2nd Straight Month,Imports,"US Imports Fall for 2nd Straight MonthUnited States ImportsImports to the United States experienced a second consecutive month of decline in March 2023, falling by USD 1.1 billion to reach USD 320.4 billion. This drop reflected weakening domestic demand, likely caused by the cost-of-living squeeze. Imports of goods decreased USD 1.2 billion, led by lower purchases of capital goods, including semiconductors, electric apparatus, and excavating machinery. Additionally, imports were down for industrial supplies and materials thanks to falling purchases of other petroleum products, fuel oil, organic chemicals and crude oil. On the other hand, consumer goods imports rose due to pharmaceutical preparations and other textile apparel and household goods. Finally, imports of services were up USD 0.1 billion, boosted by travel.2023-05-04T12:44:47.93",Financial.csv,GENERAL_FINANCIAL,0,

However, inflation has increased notably in recent months reflecting low base effects, the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices; the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen; and the exacerbating factor of supply bottlenecks, which have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal. Investors will not turn their attention to the hearing for further clues on the tapering timeline.
